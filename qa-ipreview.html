A HIPAA Authorization must comply with 45 CFR Section164.508(c) Implementation specifications: Core elements and requirements - (1) Core elements. A valid authorization under this Section must contain at least the following elements: (i) A description of the information to be used or disclosed that identifies the information in a specific and meaningful fashion. (ii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, authorized to make the requested use or disclosure. (iii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered entity may make the requested use or disclosure. (iv) A description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure. The statement "at the request of the individual" is a sufficient description of the purpose when an individual initiates the authorization and does not, or elects not to, provide a statement of the purpose. (v) An expiration date or an expiration event that relates to the individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure. The statement "end of the research study," "none," or similar language is sufficient if the authorization is for a use or disclosure of protected health information for research, including for the creation and maintenance of a research database or research repository. (vi) Signature of the individual and date. If the authorization is signed by a personal representative of the individual, a description of such representative's authority to act for the individual must also be provided. (2)Required statements. In addition to the core elements, the authorization must contain statements adequate to place the individual on notice of all of the following: (i) The individual's right to revoke the authorization in writing, and either: (A) The exceptions to the right to revoke and a description of how the individual may revoke the authorization; or (B) To the extent that the information in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is included in the notice required by Section 164.520, a reference to the covered entity's notice. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title45-vol1/pdf/CFR-2017-title45-vol1-sec164-508.pdf (        <a href="ValueSet-SzEncounterClassificationVS.html">src</a>

A displayed mark rendered to end users as a prescribed text warning that the electronic or hardcopy information shall not be further disclosed without consent of the subject of the information. For example, in order to warn a recipient of 42 CFR Part 2 information of the redisclosure restrictions, the rule mandates that end users receive a written prohibition against redisclosure unless authorized by patient consent or otherwise permitted by Part 2. See 42 CFR &sect;  2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. (a)Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by one of the following written statements: (1) This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules ( 42 CFR part 2). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see &sect;  2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at &sect; &sect;  2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32 (        <a href="ValueSet-SzEncounterClassificationVS.html">src</a>

There are examples where a medication request may include the option of an oral dose or an Intravenous or Intramuscular dose.  For example, "Ondansetron 8mg orally or IV twice a day as needed for nausea" or "Compazine&reg; (prochlorperazine) 5-10mg PO or 25mg PR bid prn nausea or vomiting".  In these cases, two medication requests would be created that could be grouped together.  The decision on which dose and route of administration to use is based on the patient's condition at the time the dose is needed.
